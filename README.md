# WordpressAutomation
This repository is created for the WordPress Automation assessment given by WPPOOL.

I have used Cypress automation tool for completing the Question E. I used VSCODE for running my JavaScript code in Cypress. In the project go the path: CypressAutomation\cypress\integration\examples\wordpressAutomation.js to find the Test suite. I have also uploaded the complete project in this repository.
